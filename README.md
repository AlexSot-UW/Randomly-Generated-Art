# Randomly-Generated-Art
This program was initially made to test out a physics formula I was working on, but it turned out that if I tweaked some values in the program, it could generate some really cool art. I posted some snapshots of the animations on chess.com a while back: https://www.chess.com/blog/svarog15/java-animations-2-collection
